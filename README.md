_This Application is called BMI calculator app that will take the user‚Äôs weight and height and calculate his BMI._<br/>
_version: 14/06/2022_<br/>

_By **Josh Hortt**_

## Description

_The technology stack to build this application is the JAMstack._<br/>
_I am going to use Next.js for the frontend and TailwindCSS for the styling._<br/>
_If you don‚Äôt know about Next.js, it is a JavaScript framework built on top of React and provides features like server-side_<br/>
_rendering, static site generation. TailwindcSS is a framework that provides utility classes to speed up the development process._<br/>
_Let‚Äôs find an API that we can use to find the BMI information. Go to RapidAPI Hub and create an account if you haven‚Äôt_<br/>
_already and then search for ‚Äúbmi api‚Äù in the search section._<br/>
_You will see different search results related to the BMI API. For this piece, I am using Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator API._<br/>
_To use this API, you need to subscribe to it first. You can do this by clicking on Subscribe to Test button._<br/>
_once you click the button, you will be redirected to another page where different available subscription packages will be shown._<br/>
_Let‚Äôs go with the free one for now._<br/>
_After all this, you will be redirected back to the original page. Here you will have a rapidapi-key. Save it somewhere._<br/>
_It will be used later during development inside your '.env' file._<br/>
